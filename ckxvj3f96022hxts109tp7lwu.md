Are you ready for the new year? Is your website ready, too? The easiest way to automatically update your website static timestamp with just one line of code, yes you heard me right

#### Only current year
```
<p>&copy; Copyright<script>document.write(new Date().getFullYear())</script>, Company Name.</p>

``` 

#### Date Range
```
<p>&copy; Copyright 2020-<script>document.write(new Date().getFullYear())</script>, Company Name.</p>

```
