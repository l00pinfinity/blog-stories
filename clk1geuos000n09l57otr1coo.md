As a junior developer at PalmPay, I interacted with so many APIs and one fascinating trend was the use of unique Kiswahili words as names of sandbox development platforms. These platforms serve as testing grounds for developers to experiment, build, and integrate applications with the bank’s systems. In this blog post, we will delve into this intriguing phenomenon, highlighting a few notable examples and exploring the significance behind these Swahili terms.

### 1\. Daraja: Safaricom’s Gateway to Integration

Safaricom, a leading telecommunications company in Kenya, introduced “Daraja” as the name for its sandbox development platform. In Swahili, “Daraja” means “gateway” or “bridge.” This choice reflects Safaricom’s commitment to providing developers with a seamless integration experience, connecting their applications to Safaricom’s vast ecosystem of services. With Daraja, developers gain access to powerful APIs and tools, enabling them to build innovative solutions that leverage Safaricom’s mobile payment, messaging, and other services.

By providing developers with a dedicated space to experiment and create new applications, KCB aims to accelerate the development of cutting-edge financial solutions that meet the evolving needs of its customers.
