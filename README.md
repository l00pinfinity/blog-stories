## About Me

Hi, I am [`COLLINS BOIT`](https://l00pinfinity.netlify.app/)

With 2 years of experience in the industry, I am a backend and Android developer. I am currently working at a fintech startup company, where I have been able to apply my skills and knowledge to help drive innovation and growth.

My background in software development encompasses Java and TypeScript, as well as a variety of programming languages. AWS, GCP, Heroku, and Netlify are also cloud platforms I've used.

Additionally, I am a strong team player and can effectively communicate and collaborate with cross-functional teams. As a developer, I am always looking for ways to grow and improve, and I am excited to continue learning and contributing to the industry.
