Hello World!

I'm ** Collins Boit**, a junior Android Developer who recently graduated from **Moringa School**. I am a tech enthusiast

I'm currently working on my personal space and sharpening my skills. I also started blogging to document my journey and help other junior devs. 

>  It's the journey every developer wants to start, to change the world and solve modern-day problems using code.

I am also a mobile gamer, I've played several battle royale games during my leisure, do send your game IDs. Let's talk and interact.

Thanks for taking the time to read my first article.
